# Game Versions
Each version of the game is named after a Greek letter and is mantained separately from the others.

Alpha: proof of concept of the game mechanics. It's really easy to play and enemies won't attack you.
Beta: it's harder to play and enemies do attack you. You can spy their actions with gold (selling food and weapons)
Gamma: you can upgrade your lands. In battles, strategy elements replece randomness.
