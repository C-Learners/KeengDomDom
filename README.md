# KeengDomDom
A command-line strategy game written in C.

# Game Description
Your are king Keeng, and your kingdom is the KeengDomDom.
Your Castle is at the center of a 19x19 map.
Your goal is to conquer the remaining 360 regions.
Each day you can do unlimited actions, including scouting a place, attacking another, increasing your army force, etc.


The game has different versions. When all the features are working correctly, 1.0.0 is reached.
If we chose to update it, 1.0.x versions are done, and finally a new stable 1.x.0 is made.

# Game Versions
Each version of the game is named after a Greek letter and is mantained separately from the others.

- Alpha: proof of concept of the game mechanics. It's really easy to play and enemies won't attack you.

- Beta: it's harder to play and enemies do attack you. You can spy their actions with gold (selling food and weapons)

- Gamma: you can upgrade your lands. In battles, strategy elements replece randomness.


# Multi Versions
These are ment to be played by 2-5 different users.
"Enemies" are replaced with actual players.
It's turn based, and players must pass the savefile to each other.
They will access their turn with a password.
A server is not needed, a Cloud service is enough.

Multi Gamma: based on the gamma version. Spies and gold mechanics are deleted
