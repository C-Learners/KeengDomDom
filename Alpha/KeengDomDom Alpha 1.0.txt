sdParent (aka "world") structure created:
Current day
Current player resources (not the conquered lands)
Productivity bonuses for army recovery
War costs
Map (array of "sdRegion")

sd stands of SaveData, data that can and must be saved.
We prefer to store everything in unsigned short int.

Current savefile size: ~7 KB
 

File operations created
- Anew: start a new game, replacing the savefile with a new one
- Save: saves all the data in the world structure into the savefile
- Load: loads the savefile to create the world structure when the program is launched

The sdParent structure can be edited freely. Just remember not to load a savefile created with a different structure than the current!


Attack and Scout actions programmed.
NewDay funcion working correctly.
